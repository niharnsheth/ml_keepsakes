# ML Keepsakes
### About
##### This is a repository of some projects that I have done, they include a variation of tools and techniques I have been exposed. This is a fairly recent repository, where I am assimilating some prjects related to ML. The following is the summary of the projects:

1. Surgical Skill Classification:
     Recently, there has been a upsurge in research for developing autonomous methods for assessing surgical skills. The current methods for assessing are manually intensive, time consuming and subjective to the grader. This project intends to provide an objective method of surgical skill assessment making training for surgical procedures cheaper and less instructor dependent. This is acheived by using time series data generated from motion sensors for developing deep learning models that can classify surgical skill. The data is collected from motion sensors connected to the surgical instruments with feature set including, eucledian position, orientation and velocities. The dataset is specific to a simulator developed at the Mixed Reality Lab at University of Illinois at Chicago in collaboration with the University of Illinois Hospital, Pediatrics Dept and is not currently available publicly.

2. Disease Classification:
    Doctors read a large number of patient summaries medical abstracts a day, these are particularly long and time consuming to read. This project intends to reduce the work load on doctors by using a NLP models that can classify diseases based on the abstracts. 
    
3. Disease Detection:
