# ML Keepsakes
### About
##### This is a repository of some projects that I have done, they include a variation of tools and techniques I have been exposed. This is a fairly recent repository, where I am assimilating some prjects related to ML. The following is the summary of the projects:

1. Surgical Skill Classification:
     Recently, there has been a upsurge in research for developing autonomous methods for assessing surgical skills. The current methods for assessing are manually intensive, time consuming and subjective to the grader. Though still in its infancy, this project involves the development of deep learning models specifically, CNN, LSTM and Siamese-CNN from time series data. The data is collected from motion sensors connected to the surgical instruments with feature set including, eucledian position, orientation and velocities. The dataset is specific to a simulator developed at the Mixed Reality Lab at University of Illinois at Chicago in collaboration with the University of Illinois Hospital, Pediatrics Dept and is not currently available publicly.

2. Disease Classification:
    Doctors read a large number of patient summaries medical abstracts a day, these are particularly long and time consuming to read. This project is used to develop NLP models that can classify the medical abstracts based on particular diseases. The data is publicly available on Kaggle. 
    
3. Disease Detection:
