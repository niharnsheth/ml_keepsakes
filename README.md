# ML Keepsakes
## About
##### This is a collection of some of the projects I have completed over time. It is a relatively new repository and includes an updated codebase compared to my previous repositories. Below is a summary of the projects included in this collection:

### 1. [Surgical Skill Classification](https://github.com/niharnsheth/ml_keepsakes/tree/master/surgical_skill_classification):
Recently, there has been a upsurge in research for developing autonomous methods for assessing surgical skills. The current methods for assessing are manually intensive, time consuming and subjective to the grader. This project intends to provide an objective method of surgical skill assessment making training for surgical procedures cheaper and less instructor dependent. This is acheived by using time series data generated from motion sensors for developing deep learning models that can classify surgical skill. 

### 2. [Disease Classification](https://github.com/niharnsheth/ml_keepsakes/tree/master/disease_classification/using_medical_text):
Doctors read a large number of patient summaries medical abstracts a day, these are particularly long and time consuming to read. This project intends to reduce the work load on doctors by using a NLP models that can classify diseases based on the abstracts. 
    
### 3. [Disease Prediction](https://github.com/niharnsheth/ml_keepsakes/tree/master/disease_prediction):
This is a collection of two sub-projects; detection of chronic kidney disease and parkinson's disease. The publicly available data is used to train several ML models to find the best fit for the application.
